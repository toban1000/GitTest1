01122720 - Five9 case number for Denmark (Mette being logged off her agent softphone).
01124077 - Variable delay between GetDigits module and Play module.
Hi,

We are finding that a variable lag occurs between the termination of a GetDigits module and the start of the next Play module. There doesn't seem to be an obvious explanation. When, for example, we make a direct copy of an IVR script in which this transition period is quite short (say 3 seconds), the duplicated script will have the same transition period taking more than 10 seconds. On the face of it this doesn't seem to be a configuration issue. It feels like a memory or cache issue, but I really don't have a clue. Do you know what might be going on here?
Regards,
Tony

Agents need to see their individual cumulative break times.

Is there a way of removing the logged out agents from the supervisor.


Why is the last leg of the transfer-to-webservice call not recorded (also found in the ireland test set up).
