Are any of the numbers you hold suitable to advertise to customers? 
Can the provider allow more than one call at a time to the number?
Who are the provider? 
What configurability do you have to change the destination the calls are delivered to?

Have you received the routers and switches that you ordered for the infrastructure re-build?




I'm just following up on our previous questions:

Are any of the numbers you hold suitable to advertise to customers?

Can the provider allow more than one call at a time to the number?

Who is the provider?

What configurability do you have to change the destination the calls are delivered to? We may be able to test the solution with a domain that is already live.

Have you received the routers and switches that you ordered for the infrastructure rebuild? And if so, what progress has been made with the rebuild?

Thanks,
Tony
