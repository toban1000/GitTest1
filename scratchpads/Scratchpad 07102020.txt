Why do you use it?
Why did you choose to go with Monkeylearn?

How do I configure the outbound campaign or campaign profile so that I am able to redial a number on a list. when I try to do this now, I get the error message campaign test is 'out of numbers'.

Also, what format should the telephone numbers be in order to upload a csv file into a list.




Conference call - with Denmark - 09/10/2020

We want to come up with a final set of actions.

Working with Amanda, I've put together two lists of numbers, 
	one listing numbers that need to stay on Five9.
	one listing numbers that need to either be deleted completely, or that need to go to Cisco.
Whatever the desired outcome, the second list will need to be ported from Voxbone (Five9's telephony provider) to the Danish provider, which was originally TDK.

I presume that Cisco is populated by numbers that are supplied by TDK.
