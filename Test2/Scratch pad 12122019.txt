Hi Craig/Gavin,
 
I received an email from the Five9 support team with the following query?
 
As previously discussed over the phone, we need to confirm the bucket. The credentials appear to work using the original pf-s3-biletix-call-data bucket, but do not work with the bucket pf-s3-biletix-sftp.
 
They want to know whether the access keys should work for both buckets?
 
Thanks,


Hi Tony, 
Our Cloud Ops team has gotten back with us.
They would be needing the information below to update the customization. 
Access Key ID:
Secret Access Key:
Region Name: 
Thanks in advance. 
Warm Regards, 
Letard Ruela
