1 - we create a call record using the caller/call details
2 - we tag the new record by assigning a temporary tag word to one of the contact fields, in this case "street"
3 - we forward the call to the second campaign using the loopback number via 3rd party transfer
4 - the first thing the second campaign/ivr script does is to check for the temporary tag. if the contact record of the
caller has the tag, the call is sent downstream to the rest of the IVR programming, and handled in the normal way. any call
that enters the second campaign/IVR without having first gone through the 1st campaign (A) (for example, callers who try to
call using the loop back number), will not have been tagged.
5 - all untagged calls are identified and directed to a play and drop.
6 - all calls that have been tagged with the temporary tag will have the tag removed before being processed by the rest of the
script. This is to prevent any caller who has successfully negotiated the tag checking step from an initial call from dialling back into the second campaign/ivr
using the tag in his contact record tagged during the initial call.




If a caller rings through with unavailable,
