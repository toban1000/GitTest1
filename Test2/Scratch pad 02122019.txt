Adding callback to CS Option 5 - Anything else:

Worked with Jason to resolved the issue with callback in which the ANI presented to the caller during the callback call was the DNIS associated with the campaign. 
We don't want this number being made public, so I have put in place some programming such that if the caller tries to call this number, he or
she will hit a play and drop and be directed to call the associated NGN.

Switched the call recording options back on for the Irish Five9 domain. Worked with Mike to fix the issue in which the softphone wasn't presenting the Pause and Resume functionality correctly.

Worked with the team to migrate the UK contact centre to Five9. Repointing the NGNs, initially with the Accessible lines, followed the next day by the other lines.
Worked with Jason, Mike and the IT team to understand the reason why installation of the Five9 softphone on the payment bay computers was being blocked. IT are currently
troubleshooting this issue.

Checked over temporary HOOP programming put in place by Mike for Norway.

Started work on creating a dashboard in Domo for EireCS. First step, to put together the reports she wants displayed. Will need to arrange a call
with Ciara to nail these down.

Continued to work with Concentrix to put together a lisf of Irish numbers and their corresponding call minutes in order to present this data
to Dominic Campion at Invosys.

Put together a list of sections and their corresponding IDs and names. I needed to make sure that all French partner help centres had the same structure
as the main French help centre. Researched the construction of a drop down menu in Java with the main French help centre sections listed.
